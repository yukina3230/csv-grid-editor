## Features

### Grid & Display
- **Interactive Grid** — Powered by AG Grid with alternating row colors and grid lines
- **Column Type Detection** — Each column header shows a type badge (Integer, Float, Text, Boolean, Date, DateTime, Time) inferred from the column's values; the type updates automatically whenever data is changed (cell edits, find & replace, undo/redo)
- **Sort & Filter** — Click any column header to sort; use the filter icon to search within columns; active filters shown in toolbar with a one-click clear button
- **Auto-Fit Columns** — Fit all columns to their content with one click; double-click a resize handle to auto-fit a single column
- **Column Resize** — Drag column borders to adjust width manually
- **Zoom** — Scale the entire grid from 60% to 200% using the toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts; zoom level shown in toolbar
- **Theme Integration** — Automatically adapts to your VS Code color theme (dark/light)

### Editing
- **Inline Editing** — Double-click any cell to edit its value inline; changes are tracked and saved back to the file
- **Undo / Redo** — Full multi-step undo/redo stack (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`)
- **Save / Save As** — Uses VS Code's native save mechanism; supports Save As to a new location

### Find & Replace
- **Find & Replace bar** (`Ctrl+F` / `Ctrl+H` / toolbar icon) — Always shows find and replace together in one bar
- **Search** — Matches are highlighted across all visible cells; a counter shows the current position (e.g. `3 / 47`)
- **Case-Sensitive Toggle** — Enable exact case matching with the `Aa` button
- **Navigation** — Jump between matches with toolbar buttons, `Enter` (next), or `Shift+Enter` (previous)
- **Replace** — Replace the current match or all matches at once; only the matched substring is replaced, leaving the rest of the cell value intact; integrates with the undo stack

### Copy & Export
- **Cell Copy** — Click a cell to focus it, then `Ctrl+C` copies its full value to the clipboard
- **Range Selection** — Excel-style selection directly in the grid:
  - Click and drag to select a rectangular cell range
  - Click and drag the row-number (`#`) column to select whole rows
  - Right-click a column header → **Select column** to select a whole column
  - `Shift+click` and `Shift`+arrow keys extend the selection; `Ctrl+A` selects everything
  - `Ctrl+C` copies the selection as tab-separated values (TSV) — pastes straight into Excel or Google Sheets
  - Right-click → **Copy with header** to include the column headers in the copy
  - `Delete` / `Backspace` clears every cell in the selection
  - The status bar shows the selection size plus live `Count / Sum / Avg / Min / Max`
- **Export CSV** — Export the current filtered/sorted view as a CSV file via the native VS Code save dialog

### Delimiter
- **Auto-Detection** — Automatically detects commas, semicolons, and tabs on open; `.tsv` files always use tab
- **Manual Override** — Click the delimiter badge in the toolbar to change the delimiter on the fly (comma `,`, semicolon `;`, tab, pipe `|`); the grid re-parses the file immediately

### Column Freeze
- **Freeze / Unfreeze** — Right-click any column header to pin it to the left side of the grid; right-click again to unfreeze

### Sort & Filter

![Filter View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robin-Reiche/csv-grid-editor/master/images/filter-view.png)

Click any column header to sort ascending/descending. Use the filter icon in the column header to open a per-column filter panel. Active filters are shown in the toolbar — click the **Filters** badge to clear them all at once.

### Column Profile
- Click the graph icon in the toolbar to open the **Column Profile** panel
- Shows an **overview table** across all columns: type, fill rate, null %, distinct value count, and min/max summary
- Click any row in the overview table to jump to its detail card
- Each column gets a **detail card** with statistics based on its detected type:
  - **Integer / Float** — min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, unique count
  - **String** — min / max / average length, top 5 most frequent values with frequency bars
  - **Boolean** — true/false count and percentage, with a visual bar chart
  - **Date / DateTime** — earliest date, latest date, range in days
  - All types show: total rows, unique count, null count, fill %
- **Dockable** — Dock the panel to the right (default), left, or bottom of the grid
- **Resizable** — Drag the panel border to adjust its size
- **Zoom-aware** — Panel text and spacing scale proportionally with the grid's zoom level (60–200%)
- **Live Updates** — The panel re-renders automatically when column types change due to data edits

### Theme Integration

The extension automatically adapts to your VS Code color theme — no configuration required.

| Dark Theme | Light Theme |

### Large File Support
Opening a file larger than **10 MB** shows a Quick Pick with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Open Full File | Load all data into the grid (may be slow for very large files) |
| Show Head | Preview the first 1,000 rows |
| Show Tail | Preview the last 1,000 rows |
| Open as Plain Text | Fast read-only raw text view |
| Paged View | Browse in 500-row pages *(only shown for files > 50 MB)* |

- **Head / Tail previews** show a banner with the total row count and how many rows are displayed
- **Paged View** — A pagination bar (first / previous / next / last) lets you navigate pages efficiently without loading the entire file into memory; editing is disabled in this mode
- **Plain Text View** — Displays the raw file content in a monospace editor-style view without any grid features

### Auto-Reload
When a file is open in full (non-preview) mode, the editor watches the file on disk and **automatically reloads** the grid when the file is modified externally.

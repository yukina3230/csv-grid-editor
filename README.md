## Why CSV Grid Editor

- Read messy CSVs without counting commas, every column lines up in a real grid
- Edit and save right in VS Code, no need to launch Excel or a separate app
- Copy any range straight into Excel or Google Sheets as tab-separated values
- Understand a column at a glance with built-in stats like median, null percent and distinct counts
- Stay fast on big files with head, tail and paged views for 50 MB and beyond

## Who it is for

- Data analysts eyeballing exports and query results
- Developers editing fixtures, seed data and test CSVs
- Anyone who opens a CSV and does not want to launch a spreadsheet app

## Quick start

1. Install **CSV Grid Editor** from the Marketplace
2. Open any `.csv` or `.tsv` file, it opens as a grid automatically
3. Double-click a cell to edit, then save with `Ctrl+S`

## Features

![CSV file shown as an editable grid in Visual Studio Code with column type badges and sort and filter controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robin-Reiche/csv-grid-editor/master/images/grid-view.png)

### Grid & Display
- **Interactive Grid** - Powered by AG Grid with alternating row colors and grid lines
- **Column Type Detection** - Each column header shows a type badge (Integer, Float, Text, Boolean, Date, DateTime, Time) inferred from the column's values. The type updates automatically whenever the data changes, whether from cell edits, find and replace or undo and redo.
- **Sort & Filter** - Click any column header to sort. Use the filter icon to search within a column. Active filters show in the toolbar with a one-click clear button.
- **Auto-Fit Columns** - Fit all columns to their content with one click. Double-click a resize handle to auto-fit a single column.
- **Column Resize** - Drag column borders to adjust width manually
- **Zoom** - Scale the whole grid from 60% to 200% with the toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts. The zoom level shows in the toolbar.
- **Theme Integration** - Automatically adapts to your VS Code color theme (dark or light)

### Editing
- **Inline Editing** - Double-click any cell to edit its value inline. Changes are tracked and saved back to the file. Press `Enter` to commit and jump to the cell below in the same column, the same as Excel and Google Sheets, so you can type down a column quickly.
- **Insert & Delete rows and columns** - Right-click a row to insert above or below or to delete it, and right-click a column header to insert left or right or to delete. Select several rows (drag or `Shift`+click the `#` gutter) or several columns (`Shift`+click the headers) first to insert or delete that many at once, anchored to the selection edge, just like a spreadsheet.
- **Undo / Redo** - Full multi-step undo and redo stack (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`)
- **Save / Save As** - Uses VS Code's native save mechanism and supports Save As to a new location

### Find & Replace
- **Find & Replace bar** (`Ctrl+F` / `Ctrl+H` / toolbar icon) - Always shows find and replace together in one bar
- **Search** - Matches are highlighted across all visible cells. A counter shows the current position (for example `3 / 47`).
- **Case-Sensitive Toggle** - Enable exact case matching with the `Aa` button
- **Navigation** - Jump between matches with the toolbar buttons, `Enter` (next) or `Shift+Enter` (previous)
- **Replace** - Replace the current match or all matches at once. Only the matched substring is replaced, leaving the rest of the cell value intact, and it integrates with the undo stack.

### Copy & Export
- **Cell Copy** - Click a cell to focus it, then `Ctrl+C` copies its full value to the clipboard
- **Range Selection** - Excel-style selection directly in the grid:
  - Click and drag to select a rectangular cell range
  - Click and drag the row-number (`#`) column to select whole rows
  - `Shift`+click a column header to select a whole column or a run of adjacent columns
  - Right-click a column header → **Select column** to select a whole column
  - `Shift+click` and `Shift`+arrow keys extend the selection, `Ctrl+A` selects everything
  - `Ctrl+C` copies the selection as tab-separated values (TSV) that paste straight into Excel or Google Sheets
  - Right-click → **Copy with header** to include the column headers in the copy
  - `Delete` / `Backspace` clears every cell in the selection
  - The status bar shows the selection size plus live `Count / Sum / Avg / Min / Max`
- **Export as JSON** - Convert the current filtered and sorted view to a JSON array of objects via the native VS Code save dialog. Column headers become the keys and numbers and booleans come out typed, while values that would lose information (IDs with leading zeros, very large numbers) stay strings. Columns you have hidden in the column chooser are left out, the same as copy.
- **Export as JSON Lines** - The same view as JSON Lines (NDJSON), one object per line, handy for streaming tools and data pipelines
- **Export as Markdown table** - The same view as a GitHub-flavored Markdown table, ready to paste into a README, issue or pull request

### Delimiter
- **Auto-Detection** - Automatically detects commas, semicolons and tabs on open. `.tsv` files always use tab.
- **Manual Override** - Click the delimiter badge in the toolbar to change the delimiter on the fly (comma `,`, semicolon `;`, tab, pipe `|`). The grid re-parses the file immediately.

### Column Freeze
- **Freeze / Unfreeze** - Right-click any column header to pin it to the left side of the grid, right-click again to unfreeze. `Shift`+click several headers first to **Freeze N columns** at once. Frozen columns show a 📌 marker before the column name.

### Row Freeze
- **Freeze / Unfreeze** - Right-click any row and choose **Freeze row** to pin it to the top of the grid as an always-visible reference while you scroll, sort and filter. Select several rows first (drag or `Shift`+click the `#` gutter) and choose **Freeze N rows** to pin them all at once, handy for multi-line headers. Freezing is additive and the rows stay in the order you froze them. Right-click a pinned row to **Unfreeze** just that one, or **Unfreeze all rows**. A 📌 marker on each pinned row shows its original row number, and pinned rows stay visible regardless of any active filter.

### Rename Columns
- **Rename** - Right-click a column header → **Rename column** to rename it. The new name is written to the CSV header row and is fully undoable.

### Show / Hide Columns
- **Column chooser** - Click the checklist icon in the toolbar to open a searchable list of all columns with checkboxes. Type to filter the list by column name, then uncheck a column to hide it or re-check to show it. The tri-state **Select all** checkbox at the top shows or hides every column at once. Under an active search it scopes to the matches and relabels to **Select all matches**, so you can uncheck it to hide everything, then search and re-check the few you want. Hidden columns are excluded from copy and export, so the output matches exactly what you see.

### Sort & Filter

![Browsing and sorting a CSV file in the CSV Grid Editor grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robin-Reiche/csv-grid-editor/master/images/demo-2.gif)

![Per-column filter panel open in CSV Grid Editor with active filters shown in the toolbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robin-Reiche/csv-grid-editor/master/images/filter-view.png)

Click any column header to sort ascending or descending. Use the filter icon in the column header to open a per-column filter panel, where you can search the values and tick or untick them with a tri-state **Select all** checkbox that relabels to **Select all matches** under an active search. Active filters are shown in the toolbar, click the **Filters** badge to clear them all at once.

### Column Profile
- Click the graph icon in the toolbar to open the **Column Profile** panel
- Shows an **overview table** across all columns: type, fill rate, null %, distinct value count and min/max summary
- Click any row in the overview table to jump to its detail card
- Each column gets a **detail card** with statistics based on its detected type:
  - **Integer / Float** - min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, unique count
  - **String** - min, max and average length, top 5 most frequent values with frequency bars
  - **Boolean** - true/false count and percentage, with a visual bar chart
  - **Date / DateTime** - earliest date, latest date, range in days
  - All types show total rows, unique count, null count and fill %
- **Dockable** - Dock the panel to the right (default), left or bottom of the grid
- **Resizable** - Drag the panel border to adjust its size
- **Zoom-aware** - Panel text and spacing scale with the grid's zoom level (60 to 200%)
- **Live Updates** - The panel re-renders automatically as the data changes, including cell edits, inserts, deletes, paste and undo

### Theme Integration

The extension automatically adapts to your VS Code color theme, no configuration required.

| Dark Theme | Light Theme |
|:---:|:---:|

### Large File Support
Opening a file larger than **10 MB** shows a Quick Pick with these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Open Full File | Load all data into the grid (may be slow for very large files) |
| Show Head | Preview the first 1,000 rows |
| Show Tail | Preview the last 1,000 rows |
| Open as Plain Text | Fast read-only raw text view |
| Paged View | Browse in 500-row pages *(only shown for files > 50 MB)* |

- **Head / Tail previews** show a banner with the total row count and how many rows are displayed
- **Paged View** - A pagination bar (first / previous / next / last) lets you navigate pages efficiently without loading the entire file into memory. Editing is disabled in this mode.
- **Plain Text View** - Displays the raw file content in a monospace editor-style view without any grid features

### Auto-Reload
When a file is open in full (non-preview) mode, the editor watches the file on disk and **automatically reloads** the grid when the file is modified externally.

## How it compares

A quick honest look at the common ways people open CSV files in VS Code.

| Capability | Plain text view | Rainbow CSV | Edit csv | CSV Grid Editor |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Opens as an interactive grid | no | no | yes | yes |
| Edit cells inline and save back | no | no | yes | yes |
| Sort and filter from the column header | no | query only | sort only | yes |
| Column profiling (median, null %, distinct) | no | no | basic stats | yes |

## FAQ

### How do I open a CSV file in VS Code?
Install CSV Grid Editor and open any `.csv` or `.tsv` file. It opens straight into the grid, no command or setup needed. If another editor is set as the default, right-click the file and choose **Open With** then **CSV Grid Editor**.

### How do I edit a CSV file in VS Code without Excel?
Double-click any cell to edit it inline, then save with `Ctrl+S`. Changes are written back to the file and you can undo with `Ctrl+Z`. You never have to leave the editor or open a spreadsheet app.

### Can I copy and paste between this grid and Excel or Google Sheets?
Yes. Select a range with click and drag, press `Ctrl+C`, and the cells are copied as tab-separated values that paste cleanly into Excel or Google Sheets. Right-click then **Copy with header** to include the column names.

### Does it work with semicolon, tab or pipe delimited files?
Yes. The delimiter is auto-detected on open (comma, semicolon, tab), and `.tsv` files always use tab. You can also switch the delimiter by hand from the toolbar to comma, semicolon, tab or pipe.

### Will it handle large CSV files?
Yes. Files over 10 MB show a quick menu to open the full file, preview just the head or tail, browse in pages or open as plain text. Paged view lets you move through very large files without loading everything into memory.

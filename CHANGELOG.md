# Changelog

All notable changes to CSV Grid Editor are documented here.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Inline range selection** — Excel-style cell selection directly in the grid. Click and drag to select a rectangular range, drag the row-number (`#`) column to select whole rows, or right-click a column header → **Select column**. `Shift`+click and `Shift`+arrow keys extend the selection; `Ctrl+A` selects everything. `Ctrl+C` copies the selection as tab-separated values; right-click → **Copy with header** to include column headers. `Delete` / `Backspace` clears the selected cells. The status bar shows the selection size plus live Count / Sum / Avg / Min / Max.
- **Paste** — paste tab- or comma-separated clipboard data straight into the grid, starting at the focused cell. Integrates with the undo stack.
- **AND / OR filter conditions** — each condition in a column filter can now be joined with AND *or* OR (previously AND-only). Click the operator pill between two conditions to toggle it; AND binds tighter than OR.

### Changed
- **Unified iconography** — every icon (column headers, toolbar, profile panel, banners) now comes from a single VS Code Codicon family, replacing the previous mix of hand-drawn SVG, Unicode glyphs and emoji. Header sort and filter glyphs are sized and centred consistently.
- A column's filter funnel now fills solid white while a filter is active on that column, making filtered columns easy to spot.

### Removed
- The standalone **Select & Copy** mode (a separate read-only view) — superseded by the inline range selection above.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Webview CSS and codicon font were missing from the published package because `media/` was gitignored in its entirety. The CI build only generated `media/webview.js` via esbuild — the static stylesheet and codicon assets were never produced, leaving the grid unstyled in the Marketplace install. `media/webview.css` is now tracked, and a new `copy-codicons` build step copies `codicon.css` / `codicon.ttf` from `node_modules/@vscode/codicons` on every compile.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- Marketplace publish workflow: switched the badge URLs from `.svg` to `.png` because `vsce` rejects SVG images from non-allowlisted hosts and was failing the publish step.
- Workflow now invokes `npx @vscode/vsce` instead of the deprecated `npx vsce` to clear the rename deprecation warning.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- README: Marketplace badges now display real version, install count, and rating instead of the literal "Retired Badge" text. The previous shields.io endpoint relied on a Microsoft API that has been discontinued; switched to vsmarketplacebadges.dev which queries the live Marketplace gallery.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- README: Added Marketplace installs and rating badges alongside the existing version badge.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Go to Row** — New toolbar button (and `Ctrl+G` / `Cmd+G` shortcut) opens a popover where you can type any row number and jump directly to it. The target row briefly flashes blue to confirm navigation. Disabled in Paged View.
- **Duplicate Row Detection** — New toolbar button scans every row and highlights duplicates with an amber tint. A banner reports the number of duplicate rows and how many groups they form.
  - **Show only duplicates** — Filters the grid to duplicates only, sorts matching rows next to each other, and switches the `#` column to show the original CSV line number of each row so you can locate them in the source file.
  - **Dismiss** restores the full table at any time.
  - Duplicate state is automatically cleared when you edit cells, undo/redo, delete rows/columns, or the file changes externally.
  - Disabled in Paged View.
